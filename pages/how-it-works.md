## How to Use Saffron

Getting the most out of saffron requires understanding how to properly prepare and use it:

### Blooming Saffron

The best way to release saffron's color, flavor, and beneficial compounds is to "bloom" it:

1. **Warm liquid method**: Soak saffron threads in warm (not boiling) water, milk, or broth for 15-20 minutes
2. **Grinding method**: Grind threads with a pinch of sugar or salt, then add warm liquid
3. **Toasting method**: Lightly toast threads in a dry pan for 30 seconds before blooming

### Recommended Daily Amount

Research studies typically use **20-30mg of saffron** per day, which translates to roughly:
- 10-15 saffron threads
- A generous pinch

### Tips for Quality

When selecting saffron, look for:
- Deep red color with slight orange tips
- Strong, honey-like aroma with earthy notes
- Threads that are dry but pliable, not brittle
- Reputable sources with origin certification
