## A Cookie Worth Savoring

These aren't just any cookies - they're a moment of indulgence. The combination of buttery shortbread, aromatic saffron, and warm cardamom creates a sophisticated cookie that pairs perfectly with tea or coffee.

The golden hue from the saffron makes these cookies as beautiful as they are delicious. When you add the green pistachios and pink rose petals, you have a treat that looks like it came from a fancy patisserie.

## The Art of Shortbread

The secret to perfect shortbread is:
1. **Good butter** - Use the best quality butter you can find
2. **Don't overmix** - Mix just until the dough comes together
3. **Chill the dough** - This helps the cookies keep their shape
4. **Low and slow** - Bake at a lower temperature for tender cookies

## Perfect Pairings

These cookies are wonderful with:
- A cup of Earl Grey or Persian tea
- Turkish coffee
- A glass of dessert wine
- Saffron honey latte (try our recipe!)

They also make thoughtful hostess gifts or a special addition to a holiday cookie box.
