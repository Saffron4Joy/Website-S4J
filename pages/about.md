    <h2>Our Journey</h2>
    <p>Saffron for Joy began with a simple belief: that the world's most precious spice should be accessible to everyone who wants to enhance their cooking and wellness journey.</p>
    <p>Growing up in a family where saffron was a cherished ingredient in special dishes, we witnessed firsthand the joy it brought to our table. From aromatic rice dishes to soothing teas, saffron was always more than just a spice—it was a connection to our heritage and a symbol of celebration.</p>
    <p>As we learned more about saffron's remarkable health benefits—from mood enhancement to anti-inflammatory properties—we became passionate about sharing this knowledge with others. Saffron for Joy is our way of spreading that passion.</p>
