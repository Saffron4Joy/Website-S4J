## The Perfect Weeknight Dinner

This one-pan saffron chicken is the answer to the eternal question: "What's for dinner?" It's impressive enough for company but easy enough for a Tuesday night.

The saffron transforms simple roasted chicken into something special. As it cooks, the golden threads release their color and flavor into the vegetables, creating a cohesive, aromatic dish that fills your kitchen with the most wonderful fragrance.

## Why Chicken Thighs?

I always recommend bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs for this recipe:
- They stay moist and tender during roasting
- The skin gets beautifully crispy
- They have more flavor than chicken breasts
- They're budget-friendly

## Make It Your Own

This recipe is incredibly adaptable:
- **Mediterranean style**: Add olives and artichoke hearts
- **Moroccan inspired**: Add dried apricots and a pinch of cinnamon
- **Summer version**: Use zucchini, bell peppers, and fresh tomatoes
- **Fall/Winter**: Try butternut squash and brussels sprouts
