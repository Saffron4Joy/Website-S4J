ingredients:
  - 2 cups basmati rice
  - 1/4 teaspoon saffron threads (about 15-20 threads)
  - 3 tablespoons warm water
  - 4 tablespoons butter or ghee
  - 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
  - 1 teaspoon salt
  - 6 cups water for parboiling

instructions:
  - "Bloom the saffron by crushing the threads gently and soaking in 3 tablespoons warm water for at least 15 minutes."
  - "Rinse the rice in cold water until the water runs clear, about 5-6 times. Soak in salted water for at least 30 minutes, up to 2 hours."
  - "Bring 6 cups of water to a boil with 1 teaspoon salt. Drain the soaked rice and add to boiling water."
  - "Parboil the rice for 6-8 minutes until it's al dente - soft on the outside but still firm in the center. Drain and rinse with lukewarm water."
  - "In a non-stick pot, melt butter with oil over medium heat. Once hot, spread a thin layer of rice on the bottom, pressing gently."
  - "Add remaining rice in a pyramid shape, making holes with a wooden spoon handle for steam to escape."
  - "Drizzle the bloomed saffron over the rice, covering about half. Wrap the lid in a kitchen towel and cover tightly."
  - "Cook on medium-high for 5-8 minutes until you hear sizzling, then reduce to low and cook for 45-50 minutes."

## The Art of Tahdig

Tahdig, meaning "bottom of the pot" in Persian, is arguably the most beloved part of any Persian rice dish. That golden, crispy layer of rice that forms at the bottom of the pot is fought over at dinner tables across Iran.

This recipe teaches you the traditional technique that has been passed down through generations. The combination of perfectly steamed, saffron-kissed rice and the satisfying crunch of tahdig is truly magical.

## Serving Suggestions

Serve alongside:
- Grilled kebabs (joojeh kebab or koobideh)
- Persian stews (khoresht)
- Yogurt with cucumber and dried mint
- Fresh herbs (sabzi khordan)

This dish transforms any meal into a celebration. The golden color from the saffron, the aromatic steam when you lift the lid, and that moment of anticipation when you flip the pot to reveal the tahdig - it's pure joy.
